# Ocean margin model for carbon transfer calculations

# Introduction
This PhD project focusses on the role of ocean margins and shallow seas in the global carbon cycle. We aim to better quantify transfer of carbon through the ocean margin domain and study the sensitivity of carbon fluxes to changes in environmental conditions in ocean margins. 

For this we develop a conceptual ocean margin model. This model, which contains simple hydrodynamics and biogeochemical processes, bridges the gap between existing global carbon cycle models and site-specific coastal ocean biogeochemistry models. Using global input fluxes of particulate and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon we will explore global ocean margin calcification,  air-sea CO2-fluxes, and their dependencies on environmental factors.  We will test the effect of changes in bathymetry, temperature and light attenuation on the way carbon is transferred through the coastal interface, and show the models applicability to Cenozoic climate excursions. With our model, necessary first order insights can be gained into the effect of ocean margin calcification dynamics on the global carbon transfer during these past events., flexible in dimensions and number of boxesWe present a new ocean margin model focusing on calcification in the shallow marine realm.
